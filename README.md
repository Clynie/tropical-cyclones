# tropical-cyclones
Tropical cyclones are one of the most dangerous natural hazards. Much about their fascinating genesis and evolution remains insufficiently understood. In particular we donâ€™t understand the relationship between maximum wind speed and heavy rainfall (flooding causes most of the damage) nor the relationship between maximum wind speed and the outer wind, which causes highly damaging coastal storm surges. In this project you will analyse the tracks and intensity of historical typhoons in the South China Sea and Western Pacific. You will also have access to new and unique aircraft data of the Hong Kong observatory flying into typhoons. These provide rare glimpses into the processes of the poorly understood eye wall. The aim of our research team you would join is to develop a new model that describes the tropical cyclone structure and in terms of the physical environment (e.g. sea surface temperature) and the properties of the cyclone. This can then be used for risk assessment for countries in the Pacific and South China Sea.
